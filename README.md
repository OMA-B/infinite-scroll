If you decided to use any of this code at any point in time, pls, be aware that the API KEY was not provided based on rule of privacy given from the source.

So, this means you'd have to generate your own API KEY, which can be gotten from UNSPLASH website: https://unsplash.com/documentation


I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through or understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
